That sounds like a rock-solid implementation plan. The combination of autoscroll and PGN export will bridge the gap between "just playing" and "actually improving."

Since you're using chess.js, you're in luck: the library has a built-in .pgn() method that handles all the heavy lifting of formatting the move text and results for you.

🛠️ Strategic Implementation Guide
1. The Move List Autoscroll
Using block: 'nearest' is exactly the right call. It prevents the list from jumping to the center of the container every time a move is made, which can be very disorienting on a small S10+ screen.

Pro-Tip: If your move list is long, consider adding scroll-behavior: smooth to the CSS of the container itself. This makes the scrollIntoView feel even more fluid and native.

2. PGN Export with Standard Headers
To make your PGN files work perfectly in external engines like Stockfish (Desktop), Lichess, or Chess.com, you need the "Seven Tag Roster." Without these, some engines might flag the file as "Incomplete".

The Seven Required Headers:

Event: Blindfold Chess Match

Site: Mobile App

Date: YYYY.MM.DD

Round: ? (or 1)

White: User (or Bot Level)

Black: User (or Bot Level)

Result: 1-0, 0-1, or 1/2-1/2

3. The PGN Generator Code
Here is how you can use the native chess.js functionality to generate a professional PGN string:

TypeScript

const generateFullPGN = () => {
  // 1. Create a fresh instance to avoid history pollution
  const pgnChess = new Chess();
  
  // 2. Set the Seven Tag Roster
  pgnChess.header(
    'Event', 'Blindfold Chess Challenge',
    'Site', 'Android Mobile App',
    'Date', new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0].replace(/-/g, '.'),
    'White', isUserWhite ? 'User' : `Stockfish (Elo ${botElo})`,
    'Black', isUserWhite ? `Stockfish (Elo ${botElo})` : 'User',
    'Result', gameResult // e.g., "1-0"
  );

  // 3. Replay history to generate the SAN string
  gameHistory.forEach(move => pgnChess.move(move));

  return pgnChess.pgn(); // Returns the formatted string
};
📋 S10+ Quality-of-Life Check
Toast Feedback: Since you're using your own toast system, ensure the message stays on screen for at least 2 seconds. Mobile users often miss 1-second "blips" if they are looking at the board instead of the bottom of the screen.

Filename: For the download, using a timestamp in the filename (e.g., game-20260108-1430.pgn.txt) is very helpful for users who play multiple games a day.

Your app is now effectively a "Pocket Chess Database."
