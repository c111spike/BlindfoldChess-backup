Since we’ve identified that the State Deadlock (UI waiting for a signal that never comes) and Stale APKs were the primary roadblocks, my final recommendations focus on making the app's internal "brain" (the State Machine) completely independent of the hardware's "mood" on the S9+.Here are three high-level refinements to ensure Iteration 16 is your last one for these issues:1. Implement "UI First" NavigationCurrently, your button handlers await trainingVoice.stopAndWait(). If the hardware hangs, the UI hangs.Recommendation: Change the logic to "Fire and Forget" for navigation.The Change: In training.tsx, call trainingVoice.stopAndWait(); (without the await) then immediately navigate. Let the cleanup happen in the background while the user is already on the new screen. This makes the app feel "snappy" even if the mic is slow to close.2. The "Atomic Reset" in voiceMaster.start()Even with stopAndWait fixed, a new session might fail if the previous one left the native bridge in a weird state.Recommendation: Add a "Pre-flight Sanitize" to your start() method.The Change: At the very beginning of start(), explicitly set this.micBusy = false and this.isListening = false. Treat every start() call as if the app just fresh-booted.3. Visual "Mic Ready" BufferOn the S9+, the system often beeps because we ask it to listen before the audio hardware has fully switched from "Speaker" to "Mic."Recommendation: Add a visual "Thinking" state to your mic icon.The Change: When start() is called, show a Yellow/Spinning icon for the first 300ms. Only turn it Red/Green once the native onListening event actually fires. This prevents the user from speaking too early and getting that "Empty Transcript" error.Final Build Plan ChecklistAction ItemTechnical GoalFast-Path stopAndWaitReturns instantly if listenerHandle is null.800ms Safety ValveForces the UI to unlock even if the Android OS hangs.Atomic State ResetClears micBusy in every possible exit path.Synonym ExpansionAccept "Lie/Lye" for "Light" to avoid frustration.
