🧩 1. The Core Logic: Color Blitz & Sniper
Both games rely on the Parity Formula to calculate colors instantly without a heavy database.

Color Formula: (fileIndex + rankIndex) % 2 === 0 → Dark Square.

Coordinate Generation: Use a simple randomizer to pick a square (0-7) for both file and rank, then convert to algebraic (e.g., 0,0 becomes a1).

🎨 2. UI/UX: The "Gym" Layout
On the S10+, use large tap targets. In a 60-second Blitz, users will be tapping fast; small buttons will lead to frustrating "miss-taps."

Color Blitz View
Top: Large timer (60s) and current score.

Center: Huge text (e.g., "d5").

Bottom: Two full-width buttons: [ LIGHT ] and [ DARK ].

Feedback: When "Light" is clicked for "d5", trigger a Haptics.impact({ style: ImpactStyle.Light }) and immediately show the next square.

Coordinate Sniper View
Top: "Find: g4" (Voice also says: "Find g4").

Center: The 8x8 Board (Empty).

Bottom: Progress bar (3/10 squares found).

💾 3. SQLite Schema Update
Add a new table for Training Stats to keep your Game History clean.

SQL

CREATE TABLE training_stats (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    mode TEXT,          -- 'color_blitz' or 'coordinate_sniper'
    score REAL,         -- score (blitz) or time_ms (sniper)
    achieved_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
Personal Best Logic: To display the PB on the dashboard, simply query: SELECT MAX(score) FROM training_stats WHERE mode = 'color_blitz' SELECT MIN(score) FROM training_stats WHERE mode = 'coordinate_sniper'

📊 4. The "Money's Worth" Dashboard
The Training Tab in your Stats Dashboard is where the "value" lives.

Visual Progress: Show a simple line chart of their last 10 sessions.

Trophy Room: Use icons for milestones (e.g., "Silver Trophy" for 20+ squares in 60s, "Gold" for 40+).

Session Count: "Total Drills Completed: 154". This number makes the user feel like they are getting a return on their $4.99 investment.

📋 S10+ Performance Note: Voice vs. Visual
For Color Blitz, voice recognition might be too slow for a "Blitz" mode.

Recommendation: Default to the Button UI for speed, but keep a "Voice Mode" toggle for people who want to practice saying the colors out loud.

Snappiness: Ensure that as soon as a button is pressed, the next square appears. Any delay (even 100ms) will make the app feel "cheap."
