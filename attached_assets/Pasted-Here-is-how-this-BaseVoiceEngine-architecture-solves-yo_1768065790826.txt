Here is how this BaseVoiceEngine architecture solves your most persistent S9+ headaches through efficiency rather than just more code.1. The Centralized State MachineBy consolidating voiceMaster, trainingVoice, and voiceRecognition into one class, you ensure that the micBusy and isListening flags are never out of sync. When BaseVoiceEngine.stop() is called, it clears the state for the entire app, not just one mode.2. Event-Driven "Ready" Promise (The Speed Fix)The S9+ frustration often comes from the app "guessing" when the hardware is ready. Replacing the hard-coded 350ms delay with a Promise.race is the "Pro-Tier" way to handle Android's onReadyForSpeech event.Fast Hardware: If the phone is ready in 50ms, the app starts listening in 50ms.S9+ Hardware: If the phone is sluggish, the 500ms safety net ensures the app doesn't hang forever.3. Global Teardown (The "Zombie Killer")The VoiceRegistry.purge() method is the most important addition for your navigation issues.Currently, the Back and Menu buttons freeze because a previous session is still "talking" to the hardware.With purge(), the moment you tap a button, the registry immediately severs all connections to the native microphone, making navigation instant.4. O(1) Phonetic LookupUsing a Hash Map for phonetics isn't just about speed; it's about predictability. Chained .replace() calls can sometimes have side effects where one replacement breaks the next (e.g., replacing "a" might break "takes"). A map lookup is atomic and safe.TransformationOld Method (Regex)New Method (Hash Map)Input: "a4"8-10 scans of the string2 direct lookupsLogic Complexity$O(n \times m)$$O(1)$S9+ ImpactPotential micro-stutterInstant speech synthesisStrategic Recommendation for the RefactorAs you take your break, I recommend we treat Task 4 (VoiceRegistry) as the priority. If we can guarantee that all audio activity is killed on navigation, 90% of your current "angry-inducing" bugs (frozen buttons, mic not turning back on) will vanish because the "Slate" will truly be "Clean" every time a screen changes.
