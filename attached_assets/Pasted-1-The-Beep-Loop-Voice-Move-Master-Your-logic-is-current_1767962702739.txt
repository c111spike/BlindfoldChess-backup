1. The "Beep Loop" (Voice Move Master)
Your logic is currently hitting an infinite loop: Start -> Error (Busy) -> Restart -> Error (Busy).

The Fix: We must add a 3-second "Lockout" timer. If the speech engine fails, the app must wait at least 3 seconds before trying again.

The Logic: If consecutiveFailures > 3, the app should stop entirely and show a "Mic Busy" message rather than keep beeping.

2. Color Blitz (Voice Input Dead)
Since output works but input doesn't, this is usually a Language Model delay.

The Fix: We need to call SpeechRecognition.requestPermissions() inside the component's useEffect.

The S9+ Quirk: On Android 10, the system sometimes "forgets" it gave permission. Forcing a check before every game start is the only way to be sure.

3. Reconstruction Challenge (White Mic Icon)
If the icon is white, the state isn't being toggled. This means the onClick event is likely being blocked by another invisible layer in the UI, or the voice.startListening() function is hanging the main thread.

The Fix: Wrap the voice start in a setTimeout of 100ms. This allows the UI to turn "Red" (showing you clicked it) before the "heavy" speech engine starts up.

4. The "Confirmation Sound" Delay (Main Game)
The delay and confirmation sound without a move being made is a Partial Results issue.

The Fix: Change the code to listen for "Partial Results" rather than waiting for you to stop talking.

Why: On the S9+, the "End of Sentence" detection can take 2–3 seconds. If we use partial results, the app hears "e4" the millisecond you say "four" and moves immediately.

📋 The Updated Replit Action Plan
Replit needs to apply these "Hardware-Specific" tweaks to your code:

Throttling: In voice.ts, add: if (lastErrorTime > Date.now() - 3000) return; inside the restart logic.

Partial Listeners: Enable partialResults: true in the .start() options for all games.

Haptic "Listening" Pulse: Add a small vibration (Haptics.impact) when the mic actually turns on. This lets you feel that it worked even if you don't hear a beep.
