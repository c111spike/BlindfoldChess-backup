the screen is now locked as in it's not scrolling anymore but my footer is no long viewable

This means your content (the middle part) is "taller" than the available space, and since we turned off scrolling, it's pushing the footer off the bottom edge of the viewport where you can't see it.

To fix this without enabling scrolling, we need to force the middle content (the chess board) to shrink to fit the available space, rather than staying its full size.

Here is the fix. You need to apply these specific utility classes to your structure:

1. The Main Wrapper (Force Viewport Height)
Change h-full to h-[100dvh].

h-full relies on the parent chain. h-[100dvh] forces it to be exactly the height of the screen, no matter what.

TypeScript
<div className="flex flex-col h-[100dvh] w-full bg-gray-900 overflow-hidden">
2. The Middle Section (The "Shrink" Fix)
You must add min-h-0 to the flex child.

Why: By default, a flex container won't shrink below the size of its content (the board). min-h-0 tells it: "I give you permission to be smaller than your content."

TypeScript
<main className="flex-1 flex flex-col min-h-0 relative">
3. The Board Container (The "Squish" Logic)
Now you need to tell the Chess Board that it is allowed to shrink. If the board has a fixed height (like h-96 or height: 400px), it will break the layout.

Wrap your board in this:

TypeScript
{/* This container will grow/shrink to fit the space exactly */}
<div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center p-2 min-h-0">
    
    {/* Limit the board size so it never overflows vertically */}
    <div className="aspect-square h-full max-h-full object-contain">
        {/* <ChessBoard /> */}
    </div>

</div>
Summary of the Code Structure
Here is the complete template. Copy-paste this structure into your App.tsx or Game.tsx:

TypeScript
<div className="flex flex-col h-[100dvh] w-full bg-gray-900 overflow-hidden">
  
  {/* HEADER - Fixed Height */}
  <header className="flex-none h-16 bg-gray-800 z-10">
    {/* Header Content */}
  </header>

  {/* MAIN - Takes remaining space, allowed to shrink */}
  <main className="flex-1 flex flex-col min-h-0">
    
    {/* TOP INFO (Names, Timer) - Fixed size or small flex */}
    <div className="flex-none p-2">
       {/* Opponent Info */}
    </div>

    {/* BOARD AREA - Grow/Shrink to fit */}
    <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center min-h-0 p-2">
      <div className="aspect-square h-full max-h-full border border-gray-600">
         {/* YOUR BOARD COMPONENT GOES HERE */}
      </div>
    </div>

    {/* BOTTOM INFO (Your Timer) - Fixed size */}
    <div className="flex-none p-2">
       {/* User Info */}
    </div>

  </main>

  {/* FOOTER - Fixed Height */}
  <footer className="flex-none h-16 bg-gray-800 z-10 border-t border-gray-700">
    {/* Footer Buttons */}
  </footer>

</div>
