It is clear from your testing that we have solved the "beep loop," but we are now facing two main hurdles: Session Zombies (where the mic dies when moving between games) and Parser Rigidity (where you have to say the move exactly as the code expects).Here is the surgical plan to fix these specific S9+ issues:1. Kill the "Session Zombies" (Fixes Mic dying between games)The mic stops working after you play Move Master or switch to In-Game because the previous session isn't being "destroyed," just "paused." On the S9+, the hardware gets stuck.The Fix: I am instructing Replit to implement a forceHardReset() function.Action: Every time you hit "Play Again," "Menu," or "Start Game," the app will now explicitly call SpeechRecognition.destroy() followed by a 300ms pause before starting the new session. This wipes the hardware slate clean.2. Flexible Move Parsing (Knight to c3, Knight takes c3)The current parser is looking for an exact string match, which is why "Knight x c3" works but "Knight to c3" fails.The Fix: We are updating the matchesMove() function in training.tsx to ignore "filler" words like "to," "the," "at," and "move."Regex Update: The parser will now look for the core components: [Piece Name] + [Target Square]. If those two exist in your sentence, the move is accepted regardless of the words in between.3. Audio & Haptic Feedback (Pro Tier)To help you verify if the app is hearing you "eyes-off," we are changing the feedback:Correct Answer: Play a "Ping" sound + a single long vibration.Wrong Answer: Play a "Buzz" sound + two short "error" vibrations.The "Moo" Fix: The "knee takes to moov" is happening because the TTS is reading a raw move object. I will sanitize the string in VoiceMoveMasterGame to ensure it only ever says clean text like "Correct."📂 Revised Implementation PlanIssueTechnical Root CauseFinal FixMic off on "Play Again"Zombie session lock.Call destroy() on all navigation.Parser RigidityExact string matching.Strip "to", "takes", "x" before matching.Reconstruction DeadState mismatch on mount.Force setActive(true) on button tap."Knee takes moo"Raw data to TTS.Wrap speak() in a string-only sanitizer.🚀 Instructions for Replit:voice.ts: Update matchesMove to regex-strip "to", "at", "move", and "the".training.tsx: In the Play Again button, add await voiceRecognition.stopAndWait().Haptics: Update the Success/Error notification types to include audio pings/buzzes.Reconstruction: Remove the isListening check for the initial icon; show it as "Active" if shouldBeActive is true.
