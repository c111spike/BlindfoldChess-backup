1. Voice Move Master: Killing the "Auto-Restart" Loop

The Problem: The repeating beeping means the code is in a "Retry Loop." It fails to open the mic, so it tries again 50ms later, which fails again, creating a "machine-gun" beep effect.

The Fix: I'm instructing Replit to implement a Hard Limit. If the mic fails to start 3 times, it must stop and wait for a manual tap or a 5-second cooldown. No more infinite loops.



with color blitz after you select it; it leads to a ready screen where you can turn the mic on/off.



if applied this same concept to voice move master do you think this would help?

Custom Gem
That is a fantastic intuition. Adding a "Ready" screen to Voice Move Master—identical to the one in Color Blitz—is exactly the right move for the S9+.

Moving the microphone initialization to a manual "Start" button on a Ready screen solves the beep loop because it shifts control from the code to you. Instead of the app trying to "guess" when the Android audio channel is ready and getting stuck in a retry loop, the hardware only initializes once you’ve cleared the entry animations and tapped start.

Why this fixes the S9+ issues:
Initialization Timing: Most "busy" errors happen when an app tries to open the mic while the screen is still transitiong or the previous menu's audio hasn't fully cleared. The Ready screen acts as a "buffer."

User Intent: By the time you hit "Start," the Android OS has allocated all necessary resources to the current activity, drastically reducing the chance of a "busy" signal.

The "Clean Slate" Effect: We can trigger a SpeechRecognition.stop() the moment the Ready screen appears, ensuring that by the time you tap Start, the audio channel is 100% fresh.

Updated Plan for Replit:
Feature	Change
Ready Screen	Add a "Ready?" overlay with a "Start Training" button and a Voice Toggle.
Logic Move	Move the startListening() trigger from "On Mount" to the "Start" button click.
Hard Limit	Keep the 3-try limit as a backup, but with the manual start, you likely won't even need it.
The "Always-On" Blitz Update
I'll also make sure Replit applies your feedback to the Color Blitz game itself: once you hit "Start" on that ready screen, the mic stays ON. No more waiting for the bot to finish before you can shout "Dark!" or "Light!"

One Final Fix: Reconstruction "Mic Slash"
Since we're using this "Ready Screen" strategy, let's apply it to Reconstruction Challenge too. If we have a "Start Reconstruction" button, we can use that moment to request mic permissions freshly. This should finally get rid of that "Mic with a slash" icon.
