there is one more issue I am having trouble with. my footer is not on the bottom of the screen. I have to scroll down to see the footer. I want this app to be non scrollable. So everything is on the screen in view.

This is the "Holy Grail" of mobile app layouts: a fixed Header, a fixed Footer, and a Content area that takes up whatever space is left in the middle.

Currently, your content is pushing the footer down because the container is letting itself grow taller than the screen.

Here is the 3-step CSS fix (using Tailwind classes, since your project uses them).

1. Lock the Main Container Height
You need to force the top-level container (usually a div inside App.tsx or your page wrapper) to be exactly the height of the screen and never overflow.

Change your main wrapper div to this:

TypeScript
<div className="flex flex-col h-[100dvh] overflow-hidden bg-gray-900">
  {/* Header */}
  <Header />

  {/* Main Content Area */}
  <main className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto relative">
     {/* Your Chess Board, Graph, etc go here */}
  </main>

  {/* Footer */}
  <Footer />
</div>
Why this works:
h-[100dvh]: Instead of h-screen, we use 100dvh (Dynamic Viewport Height). This fixes the annoying mobile issue where the browser URL bar covers your footer.

flex flex-col: Stacks items vertically.

overflow-hidden: Tells the app "If content is too big, cut it off, do not scroll the whole page."

flex-1 (on Main): This is the magic. It tells the middle section: "Take up all available space between the header and footer."

overflow-y-auto (on Main): If the chess board or move list is too tall, only this middle section will scroll internally. The Header and Footer will stay glued in place.

2. The iPhone "Home Bar" Issue
On modern iPhones (iPhone X and newer), the "swipe up" bar at the bottom will overlap your footer if you aren't careful.

Add pb-safe (padding-bottom-safe) to your footer if you have the plugin, or manually add padding:

TypeScript
<footer className="w-full bg-gray-800 p-4 pb-8 border-t border-gray-700">
  {/* Your footer content */}
</footer>
Adding that extra bottom padding ensures your buttons aren't hidden behind the phone's system gesture bar.

3. Debugging "Double Scroll"
If you implement this and still see scrollbars on the body (the main window), add this to your global index.css:

CSS
html, body, #root {
  height: 100%;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  overflow: hidden; /* Stops the browser rubber-banding effect */
  overscroll-behavior: none; /* Disables pull-to-refresh on mobile web */
}
Try applying the Step 1 classes to your main page wrapper. Does the footer snap to the bottom now?

this is an android only app

Since this is an Android-only app, we can be much more aggressive with the CSS to force it to behave like a native app (zero scrolling, zero rubber-banding).

Here is the exact code to lock your layout to the screen size.

1. The Global Lock (index.css)
First, you must tell the browser engine to stop acting like a webpage (scrolling the body) and act like a canvas.

Add this to your client/src/index.css:

CSS
/* Force the root containers to match the device screen exactly */
html, body, #root {
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  overflow: hidden; /* CRITICAL: Disables the main page scrollbar */
  overscroll-behavior: none; /* Disables the Android "glow" pull effect */
}
2. The "Sandwich" Layout (App.tsx or Game.tsx)
Now, use a Flexbox column to stack your elements. The key is flex-1 on the middle section, which means "fill whatever space is left, but don't grow bigger than that."

Update your main page wrapper:

TypeScript
<div className="flex flex-col h-full w-full bg-gray-900 text-white">
  
  {/* 1. HEADER (Fixed Height) */}
  <header className="flex-none h-16 bg-gray-800 flex items-center justify-center z-10">
    <h1 className="font-bold">Chess App</h1>
  </header>

  {/* 2. CONTENT (Flexible - Shrinks/Grows to fit) */}
  {/* overflow-hidden ensures this container NEVER pushes the footer down */}
  <main className="flex-1 flex flex-col items-center justify-center overflow-hidden relative">
    
    {/* THE TRICK: 
       If your board is too big, this container will force it to shrink 
       instead of creating a scrollbar.
    */}
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col items-center justify-center p-2">
       {/* Use max-h-full and aspect-square on your board wrapper 
          so it fits neatly between header and footer 
       */}
       <div className="aspect-square max-h-full max-w-full">
         {/* <ChessBoard /> goes here */}
       </div>
       
       {/* Put controls/status here, but give them flex-shrink so they don't break layout */}
       <div className="mt-4 flex-shrink-0">
         {/* Status Text */}
       </div>
    </div>

  </main>

  {/* 3. FOOTER (Fixed Height) */}
  <footer className="flex-none h-20 bg-gray-800 border-t border-gray-700 flex items-center justify-around z-10">
    <button>Home</button>
    <button>Settings</button>
  </footer>

</div>
Why this fixes your issue:
html, body { overflow: hidden }: Removes the global scrollbar immediately.

flex-col h-full: Creates a vertical stack that is exactly the height of the phone screen.

flex-none (Header/Footer): Forces these to stay exactly the size you set (e.g., h-16).

flex-1 (Main): The middle section takes only the remaining space.

max-h-full (Board): If the screen is small (or keyboard is up), this forces the chess board to shrink to fit the available space, rather than staying big and pushing the footer off the screen.

Apply the CSS change first, then wrap your Game component in that Flex structure. The footer will snap to the bottom and stay there.
