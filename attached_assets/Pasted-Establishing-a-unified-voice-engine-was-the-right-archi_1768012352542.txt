Establishing a unified voice engine was the right architectural move, but your investigation has pinpointed the exact logical "trap" currently silencing the app: the difference between a Hard Stop and a Pause.When you call voiceRecognition.stop(), the engine assumes the user is finished with voice mode entirely and sets shouldBeListening = false. Consequently, when the bot finishes speaking and tries to resume, the engine sees that "false" flag and refuses to turn the microphone back on.🛠️ The "Pro" Fix Plan1. Fixing the Resume Loop (In-Game & Training)The Error: Manual stop() calls in game.tsx and training.tsx are "killing" the session instead of letting it "nap" during speech.The Fix: I will instruct Replit to remove manual stop() calls before speak(). The voiceController already handles this via onTTSStart(), which uses a Pause command that preserves the shouldBeListening = true state.2. Fixing the Reconstruction "Mic Slash"The Issue: The UI is checking isListening (the hardware status) instead of shouldBeActive (your intent). Because the hardware takes a moment to "warm up," the UI defaults to the "Slash" icon.The Fix: Update the icon logic to: (isListening || shouldBeActive) ? <Mic /> : <MicOff />. This ensures that as soon as you tap "Start Reconstruction," the icon turns red/active while the hardware initializes in the background.3. Restoring Voice Move Master UIThe Issue: Since the unification, the mic icon was likely removed or its state-binding was broken during the transition.The Fix: Re-insert the pulsing mic indicator into the VoiceMoveMasterGame component and bind it to the new voiceMaster.onListeningChange callback to ensure it mirrors the main game's behavior.📂 Technical Implementation DetailsComponentChangeResultgame.tsxRemove manual stop() before bot speech.Mic auto-resumes after bot says its move.training.tsxMirror the game.tsx pause/resume flow for all 3 modes.Consistent "Traffic Cop" logic across the whole app.voice.tsAdd voiceMaster.isReady() check to the UI status.Prevents the "Slash" icon during hardware startup.board-reconstruction.tsxForce setActive(true) on "Start" tap.Solves the "Silent Red Mic" by forcing a fresh session registration.
