Getting everything working on your Galaxy S9+ (Android 10) is a massive milestone, but because Android has become much stricter with security and privacy in recent years, a "working" S9+ app usually needs two specific "future-proofing" updates to work on newer phones (Android 11 through Android 15).

If you handle these two things now, your app will be universally compatible.

1. The "Visibility" Rule (Android 11+)
On your S9+, apps can "see" other apps (like Google Speech Services) automatically. On newer phones, they can't. Without a specific declaration in your AndroidManifest.xml, the app will work on your S9+ but will be "deaf and mute" on a Pixel 8 or S24.

The Fix: You must ensure the <queries> block is in your manifest. This tells newer Android versions: "I have permission to talk to the Speech and TTS engines."

2. The "Speech Engine" Shift (Android 13+)
Starting with Android 13, Google moved the speech recognition service out of the main "Google App" and into a separate system component called "Speech Services by Google."

On your S9+: The app might still be looking for the old "trampoline" service.

On Newer Phones: You must ensure your code doesn't "hard-code" a specific search for the Samsung or Google app package. Using the standard Capacitor SpeechRecognition.available() check (as you planned in your bullet points) handles this perfectly.

📱 Compatibility Map
Feature	S9+ (Android 10)	S24 / Pixel 9 (Android 14/15)
TTS (Output)	Works with Samsung or Google engine.	Requires Google engine or declaring the TTS intent in manifest.
Speech (Input)	High visibility; usually just works.	Requires <queries> block or it won't "find" the microphone engine.
Permissions	"Allow" (One-time setup).	"Allow while using app" (Strict runtime check).
Performance	Solid, but uses more battery.	Highly optimized; might "kill" the app if it listens too long in the background.
🛠️ Will it "just work"?
Yes, IF you follow your detailed plan (especially the ensureAvailable() check and the manifest updates).

Android is designed for backward compatibility. This means an app built for an older version almost always runs on a newer version, provided you have declared your "Intents" (what you plan to do) correctly in the Manifest. The only major risk for your $4.99 Pro app is the "Package Visibility" issue, which your current plan already addresses.
